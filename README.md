## Real-Time Collaboration Workflow
**Room Creation:** When a user starts collaborating, a Socket.io room is created based on the note ID.                                                                                                           
**Join Room:** Both the initiating user and the invited user join the same room.                                                                                                                                
**Broadcast Changes:** Any updates made by one user are broadcast to other users in the room, ensuring real-time synchronization.                                                                               
**Close Collaboration:** Users can close the collaboration session when finished.
